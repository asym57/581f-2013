# Math 581F - Autumn 2013 - Computational Number Theory

- MWF at 11:30 in Padelford C401
- William Stein
- Enrollment [status page](https://sdb.admin.washington.edu/timeschd/uwnetid/sln.asp?QTRYR=AUT+2013&SLN=17193) (requires login)

## Course Goal

- Collaboratively write a book called "A Computational Tour of Number Theory"

## Grading

- Your grade will be based on your contributions to the book.
- You will write and polish parts of the book based on lectures, independent reading, research, etc.

- Create a project on <https://cloud.sagemath.com> devoted to this class with your name and "581f" in its title, and add me "William A Stein" as a collaborator.
