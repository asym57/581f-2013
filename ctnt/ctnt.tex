\chapter{Introduction: tour of the main questions}
In this book, we will explore several important central problems and
objects of number theory, and for each to explain how---in practice
(not just theory)---to {\em compute} with them.    Books,
papers, and web sites such as Wikipedia and Mathoverflow often
give excellent descriptions
of mathematical objects, algorithms, data, conjectures, and theorems.
However, they rarely give concrete instructions
so that you can manipulate them on a computer, with enough theoretical
discussion so that you understand the limitations and capabilities of
your tools.  That is the mission of the book you are looking at.


\section{Prime Numbers}
The prime numbers $2,3,5,7,11,\ldots, $ have fascinated
mathematicians for thousands of years.  Euclid proved there
are infinitely many: if $p_1,\ldots, p_n$ are primes,
then $p_1\cdots p_n + 1$ is an integer divisible by some
prime $p$ that isn't equal to any $p_i$.

Let's compute the primes up to 100:
\begin{lstlisting}
sage: prime_range(100)
[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71,
 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
\end{lstlisting}
And draw a plot of the function $\pi(x)$ that counts the number of primes up to $x$ for $x<100$.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{pics/prime_pi-2-100.pdf}
\end{center}

The {\em Prime Number Theorem}, which was proved over a century ago, asserts that $\pi(x) \sim x/\log(x)$:

\begin{lstlisting}
@interact
def f(B=[10^n for n in [2..9]]):
    show(plot(lambda x: prime_pi(x)/(x/log(x)), (x,2,B))
       + line([(0,1),(B,1)],color='red'))
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{pics/pnt100.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{pics/pnt10000.pdf}
\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{pics/pnt100000000.pdf}
\end{center}

The {\em Riemann Hypothesis}, which remains completely unsolved today,
asserts that for all $x\geq 2.01$,
$$
 |\pi(x) - \Li(x)| \leq \sqrt{x}\cdot \log(x),
$$
where
$$
 \Li(x) = \int_{2}^x \frac{dt}{\log(t)}
$$

In the range of the following plots, $\pi(x) - \Li(x)$ is
much smaller than $\sqrt{x}\log(x)$.
\begin{lstlisting}
@interact
def f(B=[10^n for n in [2..9]]):
    print "sqrt(B)*log(B) = ", round(sqrt(B)*log(B))
    show(plot(lambda x: prime_pi(x) - Li(x), (x,2,B)))
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{pics/pi_minus_li-1e9.pdf}
\end{center}
Up to $10^9$ we have $|\pi(x)-\Li(x)|$ is much
smaller than $\sqrt{10^9}\cdot \log(10^9) \sim  \num{655327}$.

\hw{Andrew and Bharath}{Can we prove anything toward $\sqrt{x}\cdot \log(x)$?}

\section{Class Numbers}
Number fields are a natural generalization of the rational numbers $\Q$,
to which ideas such as primes, and conjectures such as
the Riemann Hypothesis, etc., all generalize.  They have
been intensely studied, initially motivated by
work to prove Fermat's Last Theorem.

In this book we will assume you know abstract algebra; however,
as a quick reminder, an {\em ideal} $I$ in a commutative ring $R$ is an additive subgroup of $R$ such that for all $x\in R$ we have $xI \subset I$.
A {\em number field} $K$ is a finite algebraic extension of
the rational numbers $\Q$; equivalently, it is a field obtained
by adjoining a root $\alpha$ of some polynomial $f(x) \in \Q[x]$.
The {\em ring of integers} $R=\O_K$ of a number field $K$ is the
set of all $\alpha\in K$ such that $\alpha$ is a root of some
monic polynomial $f(x)\in\Z[x]$.  It is interesting to prove
that $R$ (as defined) is closed under addition and multiplication
(it is a ring).
In the special case when $K=\Q$, we have $R=\Z$.
\hw{Volunteer!}{Put a proof or good ref to proof in as a footnote.}

We can multiply any two nonzero ideals $I, J\subset R$ by taking
the ideal generated by all products of elements in $I$ with elements
in $J$.  With this operation, the set of nonzero ideals is an infinite
monoid (a group but without inverses).
For example, if $R=\Z$, then the nonzero ideals are in
bijection with positive integers, and the monoid is isomorphic to
$\Z_{>0}$ under addition.

An ideal $I$ is {\em principal} if there is some $\alpha \in R$ such
that $I = \{\alpha b : b \in R\}$, in which case we write $I=(\alpha)$.
Define an equivalence relation on nonzero ideals by
$I\sim J$ if $I=J\cdot (\alpha)$ for some principal ideal
$(\alpha)$.
The {\em class group} $\Cl(R)$ of $R$ is the quotient of the monoid of
nonzero ideals modulo this equivalence relation, i.e., modulo the
submonoid of principal ideals; it takes some work to show that
the result is an abelian {\em group}, i.e., every ideal class
has an inverse.

For example, if $R$ is a principal ideal domain (PID), i.e., if
every ideal is principal, then the class group is an abelian group
of order $1$.   In the following example, we consider $\Q(\sqrt{-2013})$.

\begin{lstlisting}
sage: K = QuadraticField(-2013); K
Number Field in a with defining polynomial x^2 + 2013
sage: C = K.class_group(); C
Class group of order 16 with structure C4 x C2 x C2 of Number Field in i
with defining polynomial x^2 + 2013
sage: C.gens()
(Fractional ideal class (41, i + 23), Fractional ideal class (47, i + 14),
 Fractional ideal class (2, i + 1))
sage: C.0 * C.1
Fractional ideal class (19, i + 1)
sage: (C.0)^4
Trivial principal fractional ideal class
\end{lstlisting}

One of the main theorems of algebraic number theory asserts that
for any number field $K$, the class group $\Cl(R)$ is a {\em finite}
abelian group.   This immediately suggests some basic questions.
For example, extending the computation above,
if we let $K$ vary over the imaginary quadratic fields
$K=\Q(\sqrt{d})$ with $d\leq -1$ square free, we obtain
a list of class numbers of these fields:
\begin{lstlisting}
sage: h = lambda d : QuadraticField(d).class_number()
sage: v = [h(-d) for d in [1..500] if is_squarefree(-d)]; v
[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 1, 4, 2, 3, 6, 6, 4, 3, 4, 4, 2, 2, 6,
4, 8, 4, 1, 4, 5, 2, 6, 4, 4, 2, 3, 6, 8, 8, 8, 1, 8, 4, 7, 4, 10, 8, 4, 5,
4, 3, 4, 10, 6, 12, 2, 4, 8, 8, 4, 14, 4, 5, 8, 6, 3, 6, 12, 8, 8, 8, 2, 6,
10, 10, 2, 5, 12, 4, 5, 4, 14, 8, 8, 3, 8, 4, 10, 8, 16, 14, 7, 8, 4, 6, 8,
10, 16, 1, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 12, 4, 8, 5, 10, 12, 8, 16, 12, 2, 4, 13, 4,
20, 4, 10, 9, 12, 6, 4, 8, 20, 20, 8, 3, 8, 6, 14, 8, 10, 4, 16, 12, 7, 8,
5, 10, 20, 12, 12, 2, 12, 8, 15, 12, 12, 6, 12, 7, 4, 16, 12, 16, 8, 4, 6,
13, 8, 20, 2, 22, 11, 8, 12, 6, 14, 20, 8, 3, 16, 12, 14, 20, 4, 18, 8, 6,
8, 8, 12, 10, 16, 3, 12, 8, 19, 8, 26, 10, 12, 10, 20, 8, 4, 22, 12, 24, 8,
3, 12, 18, 8, 6, 28, 8, 10, 5, 14, 16, 16, 4, 8, 6, 19, 18, 20, 12, 9, 12,
8, 10, 28, 16, 3, 20, 8, 17, 8, 20, 22, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 20, 16, 20,
16, 2, 16, 16, 16, 16, 6, 20, 10, 12, 8, 9, 10, 10, 24, 2, 16, 12, 21, 12,
24, 4, 20, 8, 15, 8, 5, 8, 32, 14, 20, 6, 12, 14, 20, 8, 26, 30, 8, 7, 16,
8, 7, 16, 20, 16, 12, 20, 8, 25, 16, 20, 4, 20, 7, 20, 9, 12, 28, 24, 8, 3]
\end{lstlisting}
Looking at this list, it is natural to guess that $1$ occurs only finitely
many times -- in fact, Gauss noticed that $1$ only appears 9 times:
\begin{lstlisting}
sage: v.count(1)
9
\end{lstlisting}
and {\em conjectured} that the corresponding $9$ fields are the only
quadratic imaginary fields with class number $1$.
Heegner (and independently, Stark) later proved this conjecture.
Also, deep work of Goldfeld and Gross-Zagier involving elliptic
curve $L$-functions, yielded an algorithm to find all quadratic
imaginary fields with given class number, which Mark Watkins has made
much more efficient in his thesis work.  (The crucial input here
was a proof that if $E$ is the elliptic curve $y^2 + y = x^3 - 7x + 6$,
then $\ord_{s=1}L(E,s)=3$, where $L(E,s)$ is the $L$-series
of $E$.)

What about the other direction: positive $d$?
\begin{lstlisting}
sage: h = lambda d : QuadraticField(d).class_number()
sage: v = [h(d) for d in [2..500] if is_squarefree(d)]; v
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1,
2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2,
3, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2,

2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 4, 1,

\end{lstlisting}
It's natural to guess that there there are infinitely many
real quadratic fields with class number $1$.
This is an unsolved problem, though it is supported
by the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics.   In fact, even proving
that there are infinitely many number fields (not just quadratic
fields) with class number $1$ is an unsolved problem.

\hw{Volunteer}{What proportion of real quadratic fields are
predicted to have class number $1$?}

\section{Fermat's Last Theorem}
Fermat's Last Theorem -- a problem from the 1600s! -- asserts
that whenever $n\geq 3$, then there are no positive integer
solutions to the Diophantine equation
$$
X^n + Y^n = Z^n.
$$
This seemingly approachable problem has a long and colorful
history.
When $n=3$ the equation is
$$
X^3 + Y^3 = Z^3,
$$
which is the (projective homogenous) equation of the plane cubic algebraic
curve $x^3 + y^3 = 1$:
\begin{lstlisting}
%var x y
implicit_plot(x^3 + y^3 == 1, (x,-2,2), (y,-2,2))
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{pics/flt3.pdf}
\end{center}
This is an example of an elliptic curve; you should
see some rational points on it---namely $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$---these
correspond to torsion points on the elliptic curve, and to solutions
to the Fermat equation with $X$ or $Y$ equal to $0$.

For general $n\geq 3$, Fermat's assertion was finally resolved by much modern
work in number theory, culminating with a major theorem of
Andrew Wiles.  The basic strategy, which is useful for
attacking a wide range of Diophantine equations, is as follows.
Given a specific counterexample
$a^n + b^n = c^n$ to Fermat's claim (with say $n$ prime), we associate
an elliptic curve (the ``Frey curve'')
$$
  E: \quad y^2 = x(x-a^n)(x+b^n).
$$
By counting solutions modulo $p$ to the equation that defines this curve (or
any nonsingular curve of the form $y^2=x^3+\alpha x + \beta$ for that matter),
we define an $L$-series
$$
L(E,s) =
\prod_{p \text{ prime}} \frac{1}{1-a_p p^{-s} + \varepsilon(p)\cdot p^{1-2s}}
 = \sum_{n\geq 1} \frac{a_n}{n^s},
$$
where $\varepsilon(p)=1$ if $p\nmid abc$ and $\varepsilon(p)=0$ otherwise,
and $a_p = p+1-\#E(\F_p)$.
Old work of Hasse (and others)
shows that this $L$-series defines a complex analytic
function on some right half plane; people then conjectured (and
subsequently proved!)
that $L(E,s)$ extends to a holomorphic function on all $\C$.
Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer even went so far as to conjecture
that most everything about the arithmetic of $E$
is determined by the leading coefficient of the
Taylor expansion of $L(E,s)$ about $s=1$.

Anyway, to the $L$-series $L(E,s)$, one can use
Mellin transform to define another complex analytic function
on the upper half plane
$$
f(z) = \sum_{n\geq 1} a_n e^{2\pi i z}.
$$
Andrew Wiles (and Richard Taylor) proved---using an ingenious
argument involving an arithmetic analogue of Barry Mazur's
deformation theory---that
$f(z)$ has the property that for
all $2\times 2$ integer matrices
$\gamma$ with determinant $1$ and lower left entry divisible
by $N=\prod_{\ell\mid abc} \ell$, we have
$$
  f(z) dz = f(\gamma(z)) d(\gamma(z)),
$$
where here $\gamma$ acts on the upper half plane
via linear fractional transformations.  This function
$f(z)$ is called a weight 2 cuspidal {\em modular form}.

Moreover, using arithmetic with {\em quaternions} and corresponding
geometry of modular curves, Ken Ribet had earlier proved that
the coefficients $a_n$ of the expansion of
$f(z)$ must be congruent to the coefficients
of a cuspform of ``level 2'', which is
impossible, since there are no such nonzero forms.
This contradiction proves Fermat's last theorem.

Much in the discussion above can be computed with
in general for any elliptic curve $y^2=x^3 + \alpha x + \beta$.
For example, we do some computations with the elliptic
curve corresponding to Fermat's equation for exponent $n=3$:
\begin{lstlisting}
sage: E = EllipticCurve([0,0,1,0,0]); E
︡Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3 over Rational Field
sage: E.anlist(20)
[0, 1, 0, 0, -2, 0, 0, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, -7, 0]
sage: L = E.lseries(); L
Complex L-series of the Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 + y = x^3
over Rational Field
sage: L(1)
0.588879583428483
sage: L.taylor_series(1, 5)
0.59 + 0.45*z - 0.19*z^2 + 0.0042*z^3 + 0.033*z^4 - 0.018*z^5 + O(z^6)
sage: E.rank() # proves FLT for exponent 3
0
\end{lstlisting}
And we can explore the $L$-series itself:
\begin{lstlisting}
sage: h = L.dokchitser(prec=200)
sage: complex_plot(h, (-2,3), (-5,5), plot_points=10)  # quite painful
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.4\textwidth]{pics/27a-lser1.pdf}
\end{center}

And, these are the analogue of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function:
\begin{lstlisting}
sage: L.zeros(5)
[4.04304401, 6.04893540, 8.21765037, 9.42919921, 10.9087283]
