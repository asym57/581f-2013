## Status reports
   - projector on to support status reports
   - status reports:
        - Another ABC idea: do the exact same computation for specific q<=1.  Do the pictures look exactly the same?
          Perhaps "1" as the *arbitrary magic number* in ABC is just wrong and there is no compelling "bifurcation"
          in behavior until around q=2?   Is there any argument at all for a cutoff of 1 in the original ABC
          conjecture?  If the numerical data fits the same a*x^b model for q<=1 as for 1<q<2-ish, then that's even
          more evidence that 1 is the wrong cutoff.  If there is a huge behavior change at q=1, it would also be
          interesting to see that.      Unfortunately, this might be a hard experiment to perform, since the ABC@HOME
          project I think threw away all triples with q<=1!

## Upcoming Lecture Topics:
   - RSA... on an elliptic curve?
   - ElGamal on elliptic curve
   - ECDSA: designed by nsa, used in bitcoin and cracked in PS3 and Android Bitcoin wallet...

Plan:

   - come in with projector on to support status reports
   - status reports: lasted all by 6 minutes of class
       - a lot of time on not-ABC
       -
   - RSA (decided to skip)
   - start elliptic curve crypto: talked about diffie-hellman on an elliptic curve, and schoof story.
